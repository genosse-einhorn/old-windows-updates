The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot run 16-bit Windows sockets application under Windows 3.1 when using
the real mode TCP/IP stack provided by Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS 3.0.
The winsock application fails at startup with an error returned by WSASTARTUP()
function. WSASYSNOTREADY or WSANOTINITIALIZED errors may be returned.

CAUSE
=====

When you install the real mode TCP/IP stack , Network Client for MS-DOS Setup
does not copy one of the files necessary for Windows Sockets support. The file
is WSAHDAPP.EXE. This file is located in the Windows NT Server CD- ROM in
uncompressed format in the \CLIENTS\MSCLIENT\NETSETUP directory and in a
compressed format in the \CLIENTS\MSCLIENT\DISKS\DISK2 directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually copy WSAHDAPP.EXE from the CD-ROM to the directory where the Network
Client for MS-DOS is installed (by default: "C:\NET"). For additional
information on configuring Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS 3.0 for sockets
support, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
